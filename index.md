# Stardew Valley Profile
## Why?
Saw u/ mairland on reddit post [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/k740st/i_spent_the_better_part_of_today_making_a/) and thought: I can probably make something that creates something similar as a web application that people who aren't good at photo editing could also get some sort of profile.  
## What?
Still in progress at this point. What I'm looking to do:
- make a base outline with HTML and CSS that mimics the template
- create a form so users can enter their name and make some selections
	- need to determine what selections are made by user and which things will randomly be generated
- have form information populate page with images and text, and possibly some random generated content on submit.
